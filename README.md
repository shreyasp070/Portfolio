• Adeptly utilized Google Earth Engine platform to develop automated workflows for generating input parameters for the regression models. The inputparameters comprise multi-spectral rasters depicting time series analysis 
  of numerous vegetation indices and the terrain parameters derived from Digital elevation model.
  
• Deployed python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn, to make the results of the regression models visually intuitive by generating the scatter plots, correlation heat maps and to identify the dominant features in the model.
• Conversantly leveraged ESRI ArcGIS platforms for spatial data analysis, raster processing, cartography and generating input grids for regression models.

• Successfully harnessed Deep learning object detection algorithms viz. Faster RCNN, YOLO, single shot detector (SSD) encapsulated under python library TensorFlow for object detection on high resolution multi-spectral 
  satellite imagery for identifying semantic objects like irrigation wells, farm ponds etc.
  
• Prepared reports and user manuals describing the final database in addition to the booklets of land resource inventory.

(2) Generation of District-level Resource Information System (RIS) for Data Driven Agricultural Development

• Successfully generated village level land use plans in addition to the inventory of natural resources viz. for soil and water for 3 districts of Vidarbha region.

• Proficiently used python libraries for developing soil sampling strategies like conditional Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) for selecting optimum number of soil samples.

• Modelled and mapped the soil properties using python libraries Scikit-learn, Pandas and Numpy in addition to the ESRI ArcGIS platforms.

• Generated seamless crop yield prediction models by deploying regression algorithms from python library Scikit-learn.

• Prepared land parcel specific crop suitability advisory along with effective soil and water conservation plans in collaboration with Vasantrao Naik State Agriculture Extension Management Training Institute, 
  Nagpur,Maharashtra, India.
  
• Prepared proof of concept of the project, to extrapolate similar procedure for complete Vidarbha region.

• Documented Land resource inventory booklets enabling the stakeholders to envision a comprehensive overview of the region.

**(2021-22) Geo-informatics Consultant at National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land use Planning, Nagpur**

(1) Projects under Adani Transmission Ltd. and KEC International Ltd.

• Developed regression models for prediction of data regarding the physical soil properties of the prospecting locations for laying the transmission towers.

• The developed models effectively predict the physical soil properties pertinent in structural design of the towers viz. soil depth, bearing capacity and the classification of soil at a particular location.

• Utilized Arcpy tools and model builder from ESRI ArcGIS for generating scripts to completely automate the process of generation of input parameters necessary for the regression models.

• Successfully deployed the models for prediction over 25,000KM throughout India,encapsulating varying terrains ranging from the Himalayan belt, the deserts from Rajasthan and Gujrat, the Gangetic and Brahmaputra planes 
  in North East to the Basaltic terrain in Central and Southern India.

(2) Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture - PoCRA

• Executed automatic generation of Land use and Land cover maps using Machine learning classification algorithms like Random Forest, Support vector machines etc encapsulated under Google Earth Engine platform.

• Conversant with data mining tools, used Principal component analysis for accurate feature extraction from satellite imagery to estimate the irrigated and non irrigated agriculture areas.

• Employed python libraries namely Gdal, OpenCV, Numpy, used them for developing unsupervised multi-level thresholding algorithms for gaining a quick assessment of land cover types in raster data-sets.

**(FreeLance) Spatial Prescience LLP, Nagpur, India**

(1) GIS ML consultancy for Prathamesh Project engineering and Management consultants, Nagpur

• Developed an automated workflow resulting in calculation of the costs and quantities of the HDPE, GI and DI pipe fittings and the necessary valves required in a particular project of laying of pipelines.

• Leveraged python libraries like pandas and numpy to develop decision-rule based algorithms derived from the estimated quantities of pipes.

• Devised a methodology to transform the drafted two dimensional structural drawings of pipelines in Autocad software into geographically referenced formats along with the requisite design labels.

(2) Topgraphic Survey and design of Sand dunes on Kashid Beach, Maharashtra for Ghatpande Associates,Pune

• Successfully conducted topographic survey to plot the beach profiles for identifying suitable locations for the construction of sand dunes as a beach conservation measure.

• Leveraged ESRI ArcGIS platforms for generating contour maps and plotting the flood levels viz, minimum beach level and minimum floor level along with the tidal levels.

• Employed the tools of ArcGIS pro for developing the land use land cover map of Kashid beach.

• Designed the sand dunes by incorporating the tidal levels along with predicted flood levels
